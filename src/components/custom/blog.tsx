    description:
      "They said freelancing would be tough. They said building a team would be harder. But here we are, started making $2,000 per week and just crossed $5,000 on Upwork! 🎉\nWhat’s the secret sauce? ",
    add: "  It’s simple:\n1️⃣ Find the right team.\n2️⃣ Fly to the sky. ✈️\n...and occasionally yell “SHOW ME THE MONEY!” for motivation. 💼✨\nAt this rate, we're wondering:\n🤔 When do we hit the millionaire milestone? Next year? Next month? Next week?\n(Hey, math is hard, but freelancing isn't when you love what you do!)\nTo anyone out there hustling:\nKeep grinding.\nSurround yourself with rockstars.\nAnd remember, the sky’s the limit (or at least until we run out of coffee ☕).\nHere’s to smashing more milestones and, who knows, maybe launching our own rocket someday. 🚀💼 #Teamwork #Success #ZuluTech\nWhat’s your favorite freelancing moment?

    description:
      'Our first Upwork project was like stepping into the ring! The client started at $150, but one bold Zuluwer came in swinging with a $1000 offer. The client countered, "How about $500 and done in a week?"\nWith McGregor-like confidence, we replied, "Listen, mate.',
    add: ' It’s $600 for top-quality, delivered in two weeks. You want cheap, you’ll get knocked out in round one!" The client agreed, and even though it took four weeks, we delivered a project they absolutely loved.\nNow? They’ve signed us for $20/hour and left us glowing feedback. 🥳\nRemember you decide your worth, not the client. Don’t fall for cheap; show them what you’re worth, and they’ll pay for it! 💪✨\nAs McGregor would say, "We’re not here to take part; we’re here to take OVER!" 🥂\n#KnowYourWorth #UpworkSuccess #ZuluAgency',
